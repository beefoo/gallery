They chopped cotton, hoed corn, picked cotton, cut spinach and picked up potatoes. However, because they had this established tent home on the banks of the Arkansas River and because they worked in and around this neighborhood, they considered themselves a class above the migrant workers who came in to harvest the crops.  This man had planted a small garden back of his tent not for the value of the garden since he said that the sun would get it before the vegetables were mature, but because it would prevent any of the migrant families from camping near them. He said, \"Those migrants don't live the way we do, course they don't have anything to live with.\" Near Webbers Falls, Oklahoma",
